-- CHINOOK DATA ANALYSIS 
--For this project I performed an analysis of a database called chinook. My questions and answers are listed below. 

--1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId ,Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country<>'USA'
;



--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE Country= 'Brazil'
;



--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate,BillingCountry
FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE Country='Brazil'
;

--4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent' ;




--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
;


--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT  emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName AS SalesAgentName 
,emp.EmployeeId 
 ,inv.InvoiceId
FROM employees as emp

JOIN customers as cust
ON emp.EmployeeId= cust.SupportRepId

JOIN invoices as inv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId

WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
;


--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
-- my first solution I wanted to calculate if the total column didnt exist. The cleaner solution is below the first. 

SELECT cust.FirstName ||' '|| cust.LastName AS Customer_Name
,cust.Country
,emp.FirstName||' '|| emp.LastName AS SalesAgentName
FROM chinook.employees AS emp

JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId

JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
On cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId

JOIN chinook.invoice_items as invi
ON inv.InvoiceId=invi.InvoiceId
GROUP BY inv.InvoiceId, cust.FirstName, 
cust.LastName, cust.Country, 
emp.FirstName,  emp.LastName
;

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT  COUNT(InvoiceId) AS Total_Invoices_2009
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT trk.Name AS Track_name
,invi.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS trk

JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS invi
ON trk.TrackId=invi.TrackId
;


--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT trk.Name AS Track_name
,art.Name AS Artist_name
,InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS trk

JOIN chinook.albums as alb
ON trk.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId

JOIN chinook.artists AS art
ON alb.ArtistId=art.ArtistId

JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS invi
ON trk.TrackId=invi.TrackId
;



--12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT trk.Name AS Tracks
,alb.Title AS Album_name
,med.Name AS Media_type
,gen.Name AS Genre
 FROM chinook.tracks AS trk

ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId
WHERE emp.Title='Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName;

SELECT SUM(inv.Total) AS Sale_by_agent
,emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv

JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId

JOIN chinook.employees AS emp
ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId
WHERE emp.Title='Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
ORDER BY Sale_by_agent desc
LIMIT 1;

GROUP BY gen.Name 
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
