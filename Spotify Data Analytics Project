# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data 
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data and created my own question to answer. My work is down below



--# What are the top 10 popular songs in the Spotifydata? Order by popularity and display the track name and artist.
SELECT track_name
, artist_name
,popularity AS TOP_10_LIST
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
limit 10
;

--# What is the average tempo of the top 10 most popular songs?

SELECT AVG( tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo IN(SELECT tempo FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
limit 10)
;



--# Which song has the highest danceability score, and who is the artist?

SELECT MAX(danceability) AS highest_danceability_score
,track_name
,artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
Limit 1;


--# List all the songs that are longer than 4 minutes and have an energy score above 0.75

SELECT track_name
, duration_ms/60000.0 AS duration_minutes
,energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms/60000.0> 4
AND energy>.75
ORDER BY duration_minutes
;


--# How many songs have a popularity score above 85 and speechiness score below 0.05?

SELECT COUNT(popularity) AS popularity_score
,speechiness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >85
AND speechiness < 0.05
;

--# Which artist appears most frequently in the dataset, and how many times do they appear?

SELECT COUNT(artist_name) AS most_frequent_artist
,artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY most_frequent_artist desc
;

--#  Which artist has the highest average energy score across all their songs, and what is that average? Only consider artists who appear at least twice in the dataset

SELECT artist_name
,AVG(energy) AS highest_avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name

LIMIT 1
